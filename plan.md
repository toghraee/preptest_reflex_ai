## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features:
1. **Landing Page** - Bright emerald-themed homepage with navbar, hero section, feature cards, and footer
2. **Authentication** - Complete signup/login system with bcrypt password hashing, session management, and protected routes

   - Smart plan generation algorithm that distributes topics across days
   - Interactive editable table for study schedules
   - Plan CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Real-time database persistence

### Database Integration:
- **Tables Used**: localuser, localauthsession, userinfo, subjects, topics, student_topics
- **Queries**: Raw SQL with sqlalchemy.text() for MySQL compatibility
- **Features**: Async database sessions, transaction management, proper error handling

### Technical Highlights:
- Modular architecture with separate page/state files
- Material Design 3 principles with emerald primary color
- Responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Session-based auth with 24-hour expiration
- MySQL-compatible queries (no RETURNING clause)

## Notes
- Database connection already configured via REFLEX_DB_URL environment variable
- Using Material Design 3 principles with emerald primary color
- All pages follow modular structure with dedicated folders
- MySQL database tables: localuser, localauthsession, userinfo, subjects, topics, student_topics
- Authentication: bcrypt password hashing, UUID session tokens, 24-hour session expiration
- Study plan algorithm: Distributes topics evenly across available days until exam date
